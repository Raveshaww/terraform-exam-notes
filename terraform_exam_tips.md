# Terraform Exam Tips
An unsorted list of general tips / notes I have for the Terraform exam from when I was practicing.
# Tips
- Read the darn questions in full. Don't rush, you have plenty of time.
- When using something with an explicit TTL, like a token or data, it is important to know that Terraform gathers the data during the `plan` phase
- To specify a specific module version from a github like, use something with a `?`, like this example:
    - `git::https://example.com/vpc.git?ref=v1.2.0`
- `.terraform/providers` is where `terraform init` downloads plugins into
- If a resource does not exist in the state file when `terraform destroy` is ran, it will not be destroyed
- The local state for workspaces is `terraform.tfstate.d`
- Github is not a supported backend type
- Terraform will deploy resources in parallel, 10 at a time
- Terraform should be considered immutable
- An implicit dependance should be considered something like "The EIP cannot be created until the aws_instance is created"
- At the time of writing, Terraform has no mechanism to redact or protect secrets that are returned via data sources
- The existence of a provider plugin in a local directory does not inherently create a dependance, but something in the state file does
- There is no `terraform mask`, and storing state remotely can provide better security
- Private module registries are free to customers, but team management and governance are not
- Workspaces between cloud, enterprises, and OSS are completely different
- Provisioners are a last resort
- You would identify the specific version of a provider in the `required_providers` block
- Terraform Cloud for Business allows for Cloud Agents
- CLI workspaces are alternative state files in the same working directory
- Retrieving the credentials from a data source, such as Vault, will still store sensitive data in plain text
- In both OSS and Cloud, workspaces provide similar functionality of using a separate state file for each workspace
- A provider block may be omitted if its contents would otherwise be empty
- A new workspace in OSS will use the same terraform backend
- Expressions are not functions
- Local backends technically support locking, but it's somewhat a mute point as you cannot share it with your team.
- K8S supports locking
- Default variable values will still be found in the state file if no other value was set for the variable
- You will not find the variable name or description in the state file
